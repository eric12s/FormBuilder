# Form Builder Application

My first web developmend project.
As you will notice, I didnt finish with building the project, as the user can't submit to exiting forms, yet.
I had less than a week, during exams period, to do my best and learn from scratch how to write a React app(and Java Script), running a Node JS server
and using MongoDB database.
I hope that you would appriciate my hard work, even if I didnt complete the whole project. I'm fully motivated to learn more on these tools
and I believe that I proofed that I have the right learning-skills.

2. Download node js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. You may change "baseUrl" variable inside "forms/src/services/server_communication.js" to http://localhost:3001/ if you intend
to run it locally.
4. Run in the "server" folder $"npm start"
5. You can start using the application in http://localhost:3001/

You can now choose to create new form in the Form Wizard, or watch the current existing forms in a table from the Table List page.

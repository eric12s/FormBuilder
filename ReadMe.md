# Form Builder Application

My first web developmend project.
As you will notice, I didnt finish with building the project, as the user can't submit to exiting forms, yet.
I had less than a week, during exams period, to do my best and learn from scratch how to write a React app(and Java Script), running a Node JS server
and using MongoDB database.
I hope that you would appriciate my hard work, even if I didnt complete the whole project. I'm fully motivated to learn more on these tools
and I believe that I proofed that I have the right learning-skills.

# instructions
First, you need to run "npm install" on the server dictionary, than run it with "npm start".
Than, run "npm install" on the frontend(located in "forms" dic), and start it with "npm start".

You can now choose to create new form in the Form Wizard, or watch the current existing forms in a table from the Table List page.
